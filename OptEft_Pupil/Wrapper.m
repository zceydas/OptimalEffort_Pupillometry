function [Results]=Wrapper()
% This script was written on August 25, 2020 @ DCCN
% The task is based on the Marie Curie proposal 2019.
% The task starts with the Capacity Phase.
% Every subject ID needs to have completed the Capacity Phase before
% task levels can be assigned. 
% Capacity phase ends when all last 5 questions of the same level
% has been answered incorrectly.
% Capacity results are interpolated by a sigmoidal function.
% In the Performance phase, based on each participant's capacity,
% Simple, Easy, Intermediate, Difficult tasks are assigned.
% During the cue period, during the fixation crosses and the accuracy
% screens, we measure pupil size.
%
% FirstSession variable stands for the session number to initate the task
% from. The first session is always the capacity session, however, if
% some subject ID entered the capacity phase before, and you'd like to
% start from the 2nd session (task levels), you can do so.
